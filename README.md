This repo includes the codes for the video on introduction to shader materials in ThreeJS. The **Starter** branch includes the starter code for the Youtube video. Check out other branches for more, and link to the videos on Youtube.

Note that the code in this branch is not final and you may encounter some errors while navigating through the website pages.

Download or clone the project on your local drive. Open Terminal (Command prompt) and navigate to the project folder. Then run ```npm install```. You should see a new folder called **node_modules** in the project folder.

During **Development**, from the terminal, inside the project folder, run ``` npm start``` command to start the server. You should see a new folder called **public** in the project folder with compiled css, javascript and all the files in the static folder. You now can visit ***localhost:3000*** in your browser to access the home page.

For **Production**, make sure to run ``` npm frontend:prod``` command inside the project folder.
